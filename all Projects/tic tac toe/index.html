                RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE<br><br>
    
                1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.<br><br>
    
                2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in
                empty squares.<br><br>
    
                3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.<br><br>
    
                4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a
                tie.

            You probably already know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It's a really simple game, right? That's what most people
            think. But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't quite as simple
            as you think!

            Tic-Tac -Toe (along with a lot of other games) involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the
            person playing against you might do next.
